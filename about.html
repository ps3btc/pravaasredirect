<p><a href="/">pravaas.org</a> is based on a simple idea: <i>High
quality mentor-ship and advice must be available to every student
anywhere in this world for free</i>. Join pravaas.org either as a
mentor or as a student and make a difference with your time, ideas and
advice. Pravaas stands for Journey in sanskrit, so let this just be a
pit stop. Post any question you may have in the <a
href="/">discuss</a> link above and a mentor will be assigned to
you. pravaas.org was founded by Hareesh Nagarajan and Prem Mohanty in
early October 2009.</p>

<p>
<a href="/">pravaas.org</a> used to be hosted as a social network on
ning.com (<a href="/redirect">pravaas.ning.com</a>). In May 2010,
ning.com announced they were going pay-only. This aggravated one of
the founders and he decided to take matters into his own hands and
host the entire network himself. The result is a much simpler and easy
to use service. And to top it all, going forward, you do not need to
sign up for a ning.com account. To post a message you just need a
Google Account! You do not need to give us your password! Sometimes
disruptive changes are for the better!
